Clockli likes pizza. He agrees that pineapple belongs on it.

Like the other Embassies, Clockli is asexual and aromantic.

If you put your ear up to one of Clockli's, you can hear faint, distorted ticking coming from inside.

The clock on Clockli's hat tells the actual time from the start of the universe to now, accurate to 1/300,000,000,000th of a second.

Clockli is the stupidest of the Embassies, posessing an IQ of only 50.6, short-term memory loss, and no concept of good nor evil while in his normal form. Unnamed likes to take advantage of this, tricking Clockli into doing things of varying stupidity, from slipping on a subspace banana peel to fracturing history into multiple Communist realities.

Clockli is the Embassy of Time, even though he doesn't know what Time actually is.

Clockli doesn't have a defined age. He thinks he's a made up number called 14 clockwuntillion years old.

Clockli and Bambro like to play laser tag together. the only problem is, unless Clockli has memory therapy before the game, he forgets what he's doing and leaves the playing room.

Clockli can exist in the 0th dimension, an omnipresent dot in the vacuum of nonexistence, though none of the other Embassies can. Everything is affected by time, thus, Clockli is the most powerful Embassy of the 3D realm. No one can kill Clockli, even if anyone tried.

Bambro thinks Clockli is ignorant, but friendly.

Clockli may appear to be dumb in his shell, but he is actually the most intelligent being in existence. He's only dumb in his shell because as his physical form is dialed down, so is his unbounded intelligence.

Clockli loves his rings. They are his most precious posession, even though they are just black rings made of ACME plastic.
